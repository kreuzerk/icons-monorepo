# icons-monorepo

This project illustrates how to use svg-to-ts to generate icons inside a monorepo.

## Setup

This project contains a application named `food`. This app will display a bunch of food icons. The
icons are located in a library named `isometric-icons`.

### Isometric icons folder

The `isometric-icons` folder contains the following elements:

- A `icons` folder that contains all the raw `SVG` icons.
- A `svg-to-ts.json` file that contains the `svg-to-ts` specific configuration.
- A `lib` folder that contains a `isomeric-icons.component`, a `isomeric-icons-registry.service` and a `isomeric-icons.module`. This folder furthermore contains the generated icons constants. Those
  constants are generated by `svg-to-ts` when we run the `generate-isometric-icons` script.

Inside the application we can then import the `IsomericIconsModule`, register our icons using the
`IsomericIconsRegistry` and then finally use an icon with the help of the `IsomericIconsComponent`.

## How to start the project

`npm start`

## How to regenerate the icon constants

`npm run generate-isometric-icons`

## Analyze the bundle size

`npm run analyze`

_Note!_ The Webpack bundle analyzer might display some missleading information. The bundle analyzer displays icons in the size of more than 400KB. Thats the size of all icons. However, your bundle is only around 140 KB. And if you check the `fesm` file in the `dist` folder you will see that only used icons are included. Means the treeshaking works as expected.
